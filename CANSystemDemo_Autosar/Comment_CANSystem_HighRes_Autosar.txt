CANSystemDemo with Autosar NM and OSEK TP
*************************************
This is an example for using the Comfort Bus and the PowerTrain Bus in the same 
CANoe-Simulation Model. 

The Gateway transmitts informations from the PowerTrain Bus to the Comfort Bus.

The models of the Comfort Bus are working with Autosar Network Management.The current state for each node  is displayed at the panel Network Management.

Both networks Powertrain and Comfort use the Autosar System Description as database format.

Also some models use the OSEK Transport Protocol. With the Diagnostic Console in the 
Diagnostic desktop you can get diagnostic informations of the engine. The information 
is shown in the trace-window. With the Fault Memory window of the engine it is also 
possible to read the fault memory of the engine. This functionality is based on the KWP 2000.

The integrated OSEK TP Observer interprets transport layer messages and displays 
them in a human readable form in the trace window "Trace TP". The transported data 
is interpreted using a CANdela diagnostic description file to display information about
the services and the primitive parameters.

The demo also shows following CANoe features:
- Signal Generator 
- Vector Ineraction Layer
- Macro Recorder
- Test Setup
- Control Panel was created with new Panel Designer
